# Akash Model School - The Roast

> Born and raised inside the Indian school system — the place where curiosity is optional and the only skill you really master is memorisation.

From day one, school felt less like learning and more like a survival reality show. Deadlines, recycled question papers, relatives treating your marks like market data — the whole circus. Exams were treated like national events and your percentage became public property.

### The Curriculum: A Creativity Graveyard

Teachers loved one sacred phrase: *“This will come in the exam.”*  
Translation: anything that actually makes you think is irrelevant. Creativity? Out of syllabus. Understanding? Optional. The system didn’t produce thinkers — it produced pristine handwriting and perfectly memorised answers.

### Group Projects - A Tragedy in Three Acts

- One person pulls the load at 2 a.m.  
- Another claims credit like it’s their birthright.  
- Someone “forgot” the chart paper and survived on excuses.

Practical exams turned into synchronized pretending. Everyone acted like they measured things while secretly praying the evaluator didn’t ask follow-ups.

### Report Cards - Emotional Landmines

Report cards weren’t feedback. They were weapons. A single bad mark rewired the whole house: relatives became unsolicited statisticians, and parents deployed the silent stare that says more than any lecture ever could.

### The Ironic Victory

Here’s the twist: in a factory designed to squash individuality, I learned how to think for myself. The whole system tried to make me average — instead it taught me rebellion, skepticism, and the weird skill of finding meaning outside the marking scheme.

> I didn’t escape the system. I outgrew it.
