    description: `Born and raised in the great Indian education system, where creativity goes to die and every exam feels like a national sport. From the first day of school, it was clear this wasn’t about learning—it was about surviving deadlines, assignments, and relatives asking for my marks as if they were checking stock prices. I spent years copying diagrams of things no one’s ever seen in real life and writing essays that teachers never actually read.

    Every teacher had that one golden line: “This will come in the exam.” Translation—ignore everything else. Forget curiosity, forget logic, just memorize and pray. The system didn’t want thinkers; it wanted repeaters with neat handwriting. Meanwhile, actual useful skills like communication, problem-solving, or not losing your mind in a three-hour paper were considered optional.

    Group projects were where hope went to die. You’d do all the work while someone else took the credit, and another guy claimed he “forgot” the chart paper. Practical exams were even better: everyone pretending to measure things they never understood, and teachers pretending to care.

    Report cards weren’t feedback—they were emotional landmines. Relatives suddenly turned into data analysts comparing my percentages to the neighbor’s kid like it was the Sensex. Parents didn’t even need to say anything; that silent stare did the job.

    And yet, through all that mechanical madness, I learned something important: how to think for myself in a place designed to stop me from doing exactly that. The system wanted me to be average, but instead, it accidentally taught me how to outgrow it.`,
